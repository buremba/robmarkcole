### Dr Robin Cole

My background is optical physics, and I have a PhD from the [NanoPhotonics group at Cambridge](https://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk/) on the topic of [plasmon enhanced Raman spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-enhanced_Raman_spectroscopy). After doing a postdoc at the [Queensland Quantum Optics Laboratory](http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/QOlab/) on the topic of Grahene nano-mechanical resonators I left academia and took a variety of roles in industry. I worked on an optical water sterliser at [Sharp Labs Europe](https://www.sle.sharp.co.uk/), then did 3 years in [medical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_physics), before moving on to working on optical telescopes at [Surrey Satellites](https://www.sstl.co.uk/). I then joined an [IOT start-up](https://www.blockdox.com/) where my passion for python really grew, and I now work as a data engineer at [notonthehighstreet.com](https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/). My main activities on Github involve in the practical application of machine learning, and I have a number of projects around deploying neural networks in the home automation context via [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
